# Agentic Development Workflow

This document describes how development work flows through this project using Claude Code as the primary development agent.

---

## Overview

Work is tracked on **Mission Control** — a GitHub Projects board at `github.com/orgs/trustdesign-io/projects/3`. Claude Code handles the full loop: picking up tickets, implementing changes, opening PRs, self-reviewing them, and moving the ticket to In Review for human sign-off.

The human's role is to **define work** (create tickets), **review PRs**, and **merge**. Claude handles everything in between.

---

## The board

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Backlog | Defined but not yet prioritised for action |
| Todo | Ready to be picked up |
| In Progress | Claude is actively working on it |
| In Review | PR open, waiting for human review and merge |
| Done | Merged and closed |

Tickets have four fields: **Priority** (Critical → Low), **Size** (XS → XL), **Category** (Feature / Bug / Chore / Design / Docs / Research), and **Status**.

---

## Slash commands

All workflow actions are available as slash commands inside Claude Code.

### Board and tickets

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/board` | Show open tickets for the current repo |
| `/board all` | Show tickets from all repos |
| `/board --all` | Show all repos including Done |
| `/create-ticket <title> [category:X] [priority:X] [size:X]` | Create an issue and add it to the board |
| `/update-ticket <number> [field:value ...]` | Update priority, size, category, status, title, or body |
| `/move-ticket <number> <status>` | Move a ticket to a different status column |

**Examples:**
```
/create-ticket Add user settings page category:Feature priority:High size:M
/update-ticket 42 priority:Critical
/move-ticket 42 "In Review"
```

### Doing the work

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/take-task [next\|<number>\|<number> <number> ...]` | Pick up a ticket, implement it, open a PR, self-review, move to In Review |
| `/review-pr <number>` | Run a self-review sub-agent on an existing PR and post findings as a comment |

`/take-task next` picks the highest-priority **Todo** ticket for the current repo (Critical > High > Medium > Low; tiebreak: lowest number first). If no Todo tickets exist, it checks Backlog and asks before proceeding.

Pass multiple numbers (`/take-task 7 8 9`) to queue several tickets — Claude completes one before starting the next.

## Branch and commit conventions

**Branches** are named by category:
- Feature / Docs / Chore / Research → `feature/{number}-{slug}`
- Bug → `fix/{number}-{slug}`
- Design → `design/{number}-{slug}`

**Commits** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```
feat: add user settings page

Implements the profile settings form with display name and avatar upload.

Refs #42
```

Commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `design`.

PRs always target `main`. Never push directly to `main`.

---

## CI

Every PR (and every push to `main` or `staging`) runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which gates merge on:

1. `npm ci` — install dependencies
2. `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` — install E2E browser
3. `npx prisma generate` — generate Prisma client
4. `npm run lint`
5. `npm run type-check`
6. `npm run test` — Vitest unit tests
7. `npm run build`

On **merge to `main` only**, a second job runs `npx prisma migrate deploy` automatically (after the `ci` job passes).

Claude will not open a PR with a failing lint, type-check, or build. Errors are fixed on the branch before pushing.

---

## Bot identity

> **Required:** `$TRUSTDESIGN_BOT_TOKEN` must be set in your shell before slash commands can post as the bot. If it is not set, actions fall back to your own authenticated token.

Tickets and PR comments from Claude appear under the **trustdesign-bot** GitHub account when the token is present. See `docs/BOT_SETUP.md` for setup instructions.

---

## Human checkpoints

Claude operates autonomously but always stops for human input at:

1. **Before starting a Backlog ticket** — `/take-task next` will ask before touching a ticket that isn't in Todo
2. **After opening a PR** — Claude moves to In Review and waits; it never merges
3. **Ambiguous requirements** — if the issue body doesn't make "done" clear, Claude asks one focused question before continuing

For multi-day tasks, Claude will move the ticket back to Todo, add a comment explaining what's needed, and tell you rather than producing partial work.
